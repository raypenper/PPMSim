PPMSim: 1D Electromagnetic Wave Forward Modeling Script

PPMSim is an open-source Python package for 1D electromagnetic (EM) wave forward modeling, designed for applications such as radar sounding, layered media analysis, and geophysical interpretation. The model employs the propagation matrix method (PMM) to compute wave propagation and reflections through multi-layer media.

✨ Key Features

1D forward modeling of EM wave propagation through stratified media.

Implements the propagation matrix method (PMM) for stable and accurate multi-layer reflection/transmission computation.

Fully implemented in Python, with minimal dependencies.

Easily configurable material properties (dielectric constant, conductivity, thickness, etc.).

Modular design for integration into larger geophysical data-processing workflows.

Open-source and extensible.
